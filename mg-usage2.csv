Although early collections suggest that A. paniculata was once widespread in Taiwan (Figure 2), more recent records stem mostly from the southeastern part of the island, especially Lanyu Island, Taitung County. However, Acmella paniculata has been incorrectly treated as an alien and naturalized plant of tropical American origin (e.g., Liu and Ou, 1981; Wu et al., 2004; Wu and Huang, 2005), an error that probably resulted from Li’s confusion of this species with A. oleracea (Li, 1978). Acmella paniculata can be easily recognized by its discoid capitula (without ray florets; see the color photographs in Peng et al., 1998, and Peng and Chung, 1999) and ciliated achenes with evident cork-like margin. In central Taiwan, it was found to have been cultivated for decades by a local farmer as a means of curing toothache and a substitute for A. oleracea (pers. obser., K.-F.
