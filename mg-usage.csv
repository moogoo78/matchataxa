In the protologue of the species, no information regarding its floral (“Flores non visi”) and fruit morphology was provided (Hayata 1913). The species status of B. brevisepala had long been controversial; the species had been synonymized under B. kawakamii or expanded to included B. alpicola (Table 2). Because of the absence of flowers and fruits, the type specimen of B. brevisepala (Mori s.n. 1910) could not be included into our multivariate statistical analyses. Our initial attempt to visit the type locality was also hindered by the fact that the information given in the protologue (Mt. Morrison) is not found on the collection label which records only the ‘Central Mountains’. By analyzing Mori’s travel log (Mori 2000), we identified Danda Major Wildlife Habitat (Danda MWH; Fig. 6A & 6E) as most likely type locality of B. brevisepala and this conjecture was confirmed when plants possessing similar leaves to the type specimens were located in this area in April 2014.\nWith plants collected from Danda MWH (Guanmen Expedition-Harber & Yu 9, 10, 11) included, multivariate statistical analyses identified one grouping (Subgroup 5a) composed of specimens assignable to both B. brevisepala and B. alpicola (type included). Because no attributes could consistently separate B. brevisepala from B. alpicola, the latter species is synonymized under the former. Under this new circumscription, B. brevisepala has a wide distributional and elevational ranges and plants occurring in the upper distributional limits (ca. 3700 m), previously known as B. alpicola, tend to have much smaller leaves (Fig. 8A). Additionally, it was also noted in the protolouge of B. alpicola that ‘immature’ berries are stylose (Schneider 1939, 1941) and some cultivated plants of ‘B. alpicola’ in U.K. also possess stylose berries with short style (Julian Harber, pers. comm.).

This was clearly a mistaken since B. bicolor is unique in being the only species in the whole genus with flowers that are white and red whereas the flowers of B. mingetsensis are yellow. Unfortunately, Mizushima’s (1954) statement was taken into action by Liu (1960, 1976), whose treatment also followed in Liu & Liao (1980) and Liu et al. (1988, 1994). Subsequently B. mingetsensis was synonymized under B. aristatoserrulata without explanation by Chamberlain & Hu (1984) and this was followed by Ying (2001, 2011). In 1963, Li corrected the species epithet to ‘mingetsuensis’, as to make it conform to the spelling of its type locality ‘Mingetsukei’ (which literally means Mingetsu ‘creek’) and this was followed by Lu & Yang (1996), Yang et al. (1997), and Lu et al. (2010). However there is no reason to believe Hayata’s use of ‘mingetsensis’ was not intentional since he also applied it to his Rubus mingetsensis Hayata (1915: 40–42) whose type was also collected in Mingetsukei. One possible explanation for his leaving out the letter ‘u’ from these two names is because there is no difference between the Japanese pronunciation of ‘mingetsuensis’ and ‘mingetsensis.’ Given this in accordance with Art. 60.1 of the Melbourne Code (McNeill et al. 2012) Hayata’s name stands."", ""is_fossil"": null, ""is_marine"": null, ""alien_type"": ""native"", ""is_endemic"": 1, ""indications"": [], ""is_brackish"": null, ""common_names"": [{""area"": null, ""name"": ""眠月小檗"", ""language"": ""zh-tw""}], ""is_in_taiwan"": 1, ""custom_fields"": [{""field_value"": ""Flowering March–April, December; Fruiting May, September."", ""field_name_en"": ""Phenology"", ""field_name_zh"": ""物候""}, {""field_value"": ""Critically Endangered [CR B1a+c(ii, iii)].
